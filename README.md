### Hi there 👋

My name is George. I am a systems software engineer at [Nubificus](https://nubificus.co.uk/). I am also studying at the Electrical Engineering and Computer Technology department of University of Patras. My interests span the whole systems software stack, from IoT function management and deployment to high-level orchestration and containers. My main focus consists of exploring and expanding the cloud native ecosystem and serverless platforms.
